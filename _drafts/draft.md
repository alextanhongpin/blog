Here are some of the questions that I've asked myself when I was just starting to learn how to code:

+ __Do I learn A or B (framework, languages, databases, etc)__ - You learn A first, then you learn B. Just get started, and you will soon get the hang of it.
+ __Do I start with Web or Mobile Development?__ - Again, learn both if you have the time. Else, just pick the one you prefer.
+ __How do I learn programming?__ - I learn by reading books, googling answers to problems I faced, and also by reading people's code on Github. The fastest way to learn it to actually code simple projects. Ps, start by coding a calculator.
+ __I don't know what I am writing__ - Neither do I, but I still code.
+ __How will coding benefit you in the long run?__ - When you code, you think. Guess you have not been thinking enough, I suggest you to code :laughing:.
