I"<p>I started programming in Jun 26, 2013.</p>

<p>It’s been a long 4.5 years :smile:.</p>

<p>When I started programming, JavaScript was on the rise and jQuery was the only library you ever needed. Now it’s all about React, Vue and Angular.js. Require.js has been replaced with Webpack and SystemJS and <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/08/18/popular-programming-languages-2016-go/">Node.js became the top programming languages of choice</a>. The growth in the programming field was exponential.</p>

<p>New languages are constantly on the rise. Golang and Swift is going to be the highlight for this year. The same goes to React Native, which allows you to code native mobile applications with JavaScript.</p>

<p>For some people, it might be tiring to keep up with the trend. But that is the reason why I love programming. There are always new things to learn.</p>

<p>From REST api design to structuring a single page application, to creating an open id authorization server and also writing scalable microservices, I’m still a long way from mastering programming. The same goes to designing user interface and experience - which I’m currently learning and maintaining my portfolio on <a href="https://www.behance.net/alextan220e3ae">Behance</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve learned that no matter what languages you learn to code in, it’s the basic that matters. It’s not just about writing a code that just work - they have to be clean, maintainable and scalable.</p>

<p>This year will be another exiting year ahead as I continue my journey. :smile:</p>
